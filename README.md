## Introduction

The 'weatherConsultationApp' app is an Android application to get, return and display all weather datas about a place you wish. Its development begins when I started to take a keen interest in the Kotlin language and its use in the development of applications on the Android platform. This application can also be used as a tutorial for learning the Kotlin language and developing applications on the Android platform.
